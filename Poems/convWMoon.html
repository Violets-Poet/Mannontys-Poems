                    <div class="inner-container"><p><span class="tab"></span>"You cheated on me!" cried the moon, "I can't believe you cheated on me!"<br>
                        <span class="tab"></span>"What did I do?"<br>
                        <span class="tab"></span>"Even though you said it under the sun - when I wasn't there, when you thought I couldn't
                        hear you - I saw you that night," sorrow filled its voice, "I put on my most dazzling stars for you, I cleared away
                        all my clouds for you, and you still didn't - and you still <span class="ihw">couldn't</span> take your eyes off of her!"<br><br>
                    
                        <span class="tab"></span>The moon paced around. Apparently, I had hurt it. Apparently, I was in the wrong? But I
                        knew I wasn't. What did it expect?<br><br>
                    
                        <span class="tab"></span>"Oh, how many times have you told her, 'Isn't the moon pretty?' And every time, like a
                        fool, I thought you were talking about me. Oh, how stupid of me. I should've seen the signs! I should've been
                        jealous from the start!"<br>
                        <span class="tab"></span>"Yes, you should have! You should always be jealous of her!" The words left my mouth before
                        I could think. Not that I could think straight with her on my mind anyway. "She's perfect! Her beauty is perfect!
                        Everything about her is perfect! How could anything not be jealous of her!"
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <span class="tab"></span>The moon cried. I knew how it felt. It cried like the countless times I wanted to cry over
                        her - like the one time I actually did. And just like me then, it couldn't stop crying. The air got heavy with its
                        sad and cold tears, just like my heart did with mine back then.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <span class="tab"></span>"You said it, didn't you? You told her she's more beautiful than me?"
                        <br>
                        <span class="tab"></span>"She <span class="ihw">is</span> more beautiful than you!"
                        <br>
                        <span class="tab"></span>"How could you?! How could you - you who never breaks a word - break your vow to me! You're
                        just like the rest of them-"
                        <br>
                        <span class="tab"></span>"Do NOT compare me to them! I would never throw your name in vain. I would never run about
                        and call every other girl beautiful, let alone more beautiful than you. But her... there's no one and nothing even
                        remotely close to how beautiful and lovely she is. Not even you."
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <span class="tab"></span>The moon sobbed. "Is she worth it? Is she worth the pain that I can clearly see you're in
                        because of her? Is she worth you crying when I know nothing else can make you cry? Is she worth the time, energy,
                        and mental space you give her? Is she worth the overflow of emotions? Even now as you're writing, I'm no longer
                        'Luna,' I'm just 'The moon.' I'm no longer 'her,' <span class="ihw">I'm not even a she</span>, I'm an 'it!' Is she worth throwing away all
                        the poems you wrote for me? All the poetry you said in my name? Throwing away our time together? Is she worth our
                        relationship? Is she worth it?"
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <span class="tab"></span>"She's worth it and so much more! She's worth more than everything I own and everything I
                        am. She's worth living for, even if it means I'll be in constant pain and agony. As long as she's there, even if
                        from afar, then a life, even in this pain, is better than death, even for me."
                        <br>
                        <span class="tab"></span>"And what about all those dark nights when I was the only one there for you? What about‚Äî"
                        <br>
                        <span class="tab"></span>"She's worth it! She's worth it all! She's worth so much more! I love her! I love her more
                        than I've ever loved you! I love her more than I thought I'm even capable of loving something or someone! I love her
                        more than what should be possible! I love her!"
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <span class="tab"></span>The moon refused to speak further. I don't think it will ever talk to me again.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                            I love her.

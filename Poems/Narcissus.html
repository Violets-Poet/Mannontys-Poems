                    <p>
                        A lot is in my heart, locked up by your command<br>
                        Now that it‚Äôs free, it‚Äôll drown the entire land.<br>
                        I thought about your love, untangled each strand,<br>
                        And I realized it‚Äôs endless, eternal, all of time it spanned.<br>
                        So I‚Äôll start with an old tale, one that you know well,<br>
                        Or do you? Not really, only half of it mademoiselle.<br>
                        <br>                    
                        Not so long ago, or maybe it was, I can‚Äôt tell,<br>
                        In your charm time lost meaning, I‚Äôve fallen under a spell.<br>
                        Fixed to a mere image, the hero under a curse fell,<br>
                        Revenge by a goddess, he‚Äôd soon be an empty shell.<br>
                        Or so the story goes, little do people know,<br>
                        He wasn‚Äôt the fairest of them all, it was you who‚Äôd always glow.<br>
                        <br>
                        Across the pond, a melody broke his gaze,<br>
                        He heard your laughter, oh who wouldn‚Äôt it amaze.<br>
                        It‚Äôs a song as soft as a flower,<br>
                        Even your voice, a symphony so sweet,<br>
                        Played by angels, in every heart it takes a seat.<br>
                        <br>
                        Then your sight caught his eyes,<br>
                        Your grace renders the gods no more than flies.<br>
                        The curse was broken, your beauty was the cure<br>
                        Oh but it wasn‚Äôt, it was just one more curse he‚Äôd endure.<br>
                        <br>
                        He watched as under your touch flowers bloomed,<br>
                        None like he‚Äôd ever seen before, he was raptly consumed.<br>
                        With petals white as moonlit snow, heart of vibrant gold,<br>
                        The flower stood in grace holding stories to be told.<br>
                        Its slender stem, a tender green, holds up the fragrant bloom,<br>
                        A beacon of the coming spring, dispelling winter‚Äôs gloom.<br>
                        More beautiful than the gods‚Äô creation, after all it was perfect you,<br>
                        Who made it into your picture, of your elegance, it reflected just a clue.<br>
                        <br>
                        Chasing after you as fas as he could,<br>
                        Then he passed the flowers and he stood.<br>
                        In the breeze their scent flew,<br>
                        He realised he would never be worthy of you,<br>
                        and he stuck next to the flowers like glue.<br>
                        <br>
                        In an attempt to etch your beauty in his mind,<br>
                        He scratched away his eyes until he turned himself blind.<br>
                        After you, no other thing is worth seeing,<br>
                        In your presence, everything else's beauty is fleeing.<br>
                        <br>
                        People came and saw the flowers next to him,<br>
                        After his false charms, they turned it into an eponym.<br>
                        <br>
                        Eons later, the heroes have changed,<br>
                        So did your beauty, like fine wine it aged.<br>
                        Although seemingly impossible,<br>
                        You get more perfect each day,<br>
                        Even to a blind person it's cogniscible,<br>
                        You lead my mind astray.<br>
                        <br>
                        With you, I became obsessed,<br>
                        Now I'm flooding with feelings I have supressed.<br>
                        Just like the previous one, I'm unworthy, I know,<br>
                        But I hope to one day be, I hope to one day grow.<br>
                        <br>
                        I know you weren't his, or anyone's before,<br>
                        But I hope to call you mine,<br>
                        I wish you call you mine,<br>
                        I hope it isn't a chore.<br>
                        <br>
                        Even if you aren't, I'll forever be yours,<br>
                        Your perfection my mind forever adores.<br>
                        And I'll always love you,<br>
                        So much you won't have a clue,<br>
                        Be it in brown or blue,<br>
                        Without you I'm nothing, I assure you it's true.<br>
                        <br>
                        A lot is in my heart, now pouring by your command,<br>
                        The start of a new tale, that'll be heard all over the land,<br>
                        I think about your love, contemplate each strand,<br>
                        I'm sure it's you and I, it was already preplanned.<br>

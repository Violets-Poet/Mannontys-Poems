                    <p>
                        Many poems I‚Äôve written about your beauty, and many more to come,<br>
                        But in this one I‚Äôd like to appreciate your intellect, like it I‚Äôve seen none.<br>
                        It‚Äôs beautiful and magnificent, and I know you don‚Äôt see,<br>
                        Oh how I wish I‚Äôd give you my eyes, so you‚Äôd finally agree,<br>
                        Not just on this matter, but also on how wonderfully gorgeous,<br>
                        And breathtakingly interesting you always be.<br>
                        <br>
                        You‚Äôre ingenious, and I have to admit.<br>
                        Your mind is a maze that made me submit.<br>
                        It‚Äôs a labyrinth, and a resplendent one<br>
                        Where every turn screams ‚Äúthe game is on.‚Äù<br>
                        The most interesting ever, there‚Äôs no doubt,<br>
                        Even compared to mine, your mind is paramount.<br>
                        <br>
                        Your personality, it's so special, it‚Äôs so rare,<br>
                        With it I‚Äôve fallen in love, over and over,<br>
                        more than a million times I swear.<br>
                        Everything you do traps me in a net,<br>
                        After all, you‚Äôre the most unique human being I‚Äôve ever met,<br>
                        It‚Äôs how you took everything else out of my head,<br>
                        And, without rent, you‚Äôve been living in it and my heart,<br>
                        And now I can‚Äôt bear for us to be apart.<br>
                        <br>
                        I must admit, I like you physically, how could I not?<br>
                        But with your mind I‚Äôm numbly in love‚Ä¶<br>
                        Without your mind I wouldn‚Äôt have rebelieved in love,<br>
                        And not just rebelieved, you completely redefined it,<br>
                        I didn‚Äôt know people could love like this,<br>
                        I didn‚Äôt know <span class="ihw">I</span> could love like this,<br>
                        And it‚Äôs all thanks to your uniqueness,<br>
                        That I‚Äôve been saved from turning into rot.<br>
                        <br>
                        In your mind I wander like an astronaut,<br>
                        In an endless space that surrounds me with overwhelming mystery,<br>
                        No matter how much I try, it‚Äôs all for naught,<br>
                        Even if I were Holmes, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to untangle you,<br>
                        I wouldn‚Äôt be able to break free,<br>
                        You‚Äôre a puzzle no one can solve, but I hope in the end it‚Äôll be me.<br>
                        <br>
                        In your mind, I‚Äôve done nothing but commend,<br>
                        But I have to tell you, there‚Äôs one thing you won‚Äôt comprehend,<br>
                        Despite your huge intellect and your sparking intelligence,<br>
                        Despite your mind‚Äôs harmony and cadence,<br>
                        You won‚Äôt ever truly know,<br>
                        How much I love you, I‚Äôm sorry but it‚Äôs true,<br>
                        To realize it, you have absolutely no chance,<br>
                        But I‚Äôlll still try, isn‚Äôt that the peak of romance?<br>
                        <br>
                        In the dead of night, in the rush of day,<br>
                        I want to shout, I want to scream, I want to say<br>
                        ‚ÄúI love you. I love you! I LOVE YOU!‚Äù<br>
                        Over and over and over again<br>
                        But even then you wouldn‚Äôt have the faintest clue<br>
                        As to how much I love you, it drives me insane.<br>
                        <br>
                        Anything I write won‚Äôt ever be enough,<br>
                        Even if a hundred times over, it won‚Äôt express my love.<br>
                        Neither in quality nor quantity are they worthy of you,<br>
                        Nothing and no one will be enough, but I‚Äôll always try to.<br>
                        <br>
                        I'll whisper I love you in your ear until my face turns blue,<br>
                        I'll kiss you slowly, again and again,<br>
                        Until on your skin, my lips become a tattoo.<br>
                        I'll hold you tight all night long,<br>
                        And in the day too,<br>
                        Because between my arms is where you belong.<br>
                        <br>
                        I'll create time, I'll create energy, I'll break all the rules,<br>
                        Just to make you happy,<br>
                        Just to see your smiling eyes shine like jewels.<br>
                        I don't care if anyone my actions redicules,<br>
                        All that matters is you, you and only you.<br>
                        <br>
                        I'm sorry I'll never be enough,<br>
                        I'm sorry your beautiful mind can't comprehend,<br>
                        I'm sorry you'll never know how I truly feel,<br>
                        I'm sorry, this isn't a conjecture, it's all real.<br>
                        No one will fit your mind's perfect architecture,<br>
                        Or your beauty, which should be taught in lectures.<br>
                        <br>
                        For all of that and much more,<br>
                        You'll also never know, how thankful I am for you;<br>
                        For your existence, for your friendship, for your companionship,<br>
                        For your smile, for your laughter that I adore.<br>
                        But more importantly than all,<br>
                        I'm thankful for your choice of me,<br>
                        I'm thankful for making me whole.<br>
